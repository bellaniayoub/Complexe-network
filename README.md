This is our final year project, where we worked on building four machine learning models for predicting influencer nodes in a complexe network given.
Additionaly we integreted the models in a user interface using django freamwork to give the user the chance to uppload his network as a csv file and knows influencer nodes in this network based on the algorithm he choses.
In this repository you'll find all the source code and the datasets used in the training and integration of models {Maybe this is not organised :( }
We used to build this project: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, Scikit-learn, joblib, and Matplotlib.
